# SSL

As part of the connection options, you can specify the `ssl` object property or a string containing the SSL profile content.

```ts
ssl?: string | SslOptions;
```

See full list of [SslOptions](../../../typings/mysql/lib/Connection.d.ts), which are in the same format as [tls.createSecureContext](https://nodejs.org/api/tls.html#tls_tls_createsecurecontext_options).

## SSL Options

To enable SSL without manually providing certificates and assuming they are already trusted by the host machine, you can specify an empty object, for example:

```ts
const connection = mysql.createConnection({
  host: 'localhost',
  ssl: {}
});
```

You can also specify custom certificate(s) as an individual string or array of strings. Please note the arguments expect a string of the certificate, not a file name to the certificate:

```ts
const fs = require('node:fs');

const connection = mysql.createConnection({
  host: 'localhost',
  ssl: {
    ca: fs.readFileSync(__dirname + '/mysql-ca.crt')
  }
});
```

When a certificate is read from an environment variable, it's recommended to replace escaped `\n` characters with proper new line characters, for example:

```ts
const connection = mysql.createConnection({
  host: 'localhost',
  ssl: {
    ca: process.env.DB_SSL_CA?.replace(/\\n/gm, '\n')
  }
});
```

You can also connect to a MySQL server without properly providing an appropriate CA to trust. **This is highly discouraged** as being insecure.

```ts
const connection = mysql.createConnection({
  host: 'localhost',
  ssl: {
    // Beware, set `rejectUnauthorized` as `false` is strongly discouraged for security reasons:
    rejectUnauthorized: false
  }
});
```

## SSL Profile (deprecated)

Alternativelly you can also specify a string containing name of SSL profile:

```ts
const connection = mysql.createConnection({
  host: 'localhost',
  ssl: 'Amazon RDS'
});
```

Following profiles are included in the package:

* `Amazon RDS` - contains certificates from https://rds.amazonaws.com/doc/rds-ssl-ca-cert.pem and https://s3.amazonaws.com/rds-downloads/rds-combined-ca-bundle.pem
