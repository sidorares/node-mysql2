# SSL

As part of the connection options one can specify an object with ssl parameters or a string containing name of SSL profile (__deprecated__).

```ts
ssl?: string | SslOptions;
```

See full list of [SslOptions](../../../typings/mysql/lib/Connection.d.ts), which are in the same format as [tls.createSecureContext](https://nodejs.org/api/tls.html#tls_tls_createsecurecontext_options).

## SSL Options

To enable SSL without manually providing certificates and assuming they are already trusted by the host machine, you can specify empty object:

```ts
const connection = await mysql.createConnection({
  host: 'localhost',
  ssl: {}
})
```

You can also specify custom certificate(s) as an individual string or array of strings. Please note the arguments expect a string of the certificate, not a file name to the certificate:

```ts
const connection = await mysql.createConnection({
  host: 'localhost',
  ssl: {
    ca: fs.readFileSync(__dirname + '/mysql-ca.crt')
  }
})
```

When certificate is read from environment variable, you might need to replace escaped `\n` characters with proper new line characters:

```ts
const connection = await mysql.createConnection({
  host: 'localhost',
  ssl: {
    ca: process.env.DB_SSL_CA?.replace(/\\n/gm, '\n')
  }
})
```

## SSL Certificate Bundle

Alternatively, you can use a bundle with CA certificates. For example for Amazon RDS you could use:

```ts
import awsCaBundle from 'aws-ssl-profiles';

const connection = await mysql.createConnection({
  host: 'db.id.ap-southeast-2.rds.amazonaws.com',
  ssl: awsCaBundle,
})
```

For detailed instructions, please follow [aws-ssl-profiles](https://github.com/mysqljs/aws-ssl-profiles) documentation.

## SSL Profile (deprecated)

There is also a **deprecated option** allowing to specify a string containing name of SSL profile:

```ts
const connection = await mysql.createConnection({
  host: 'localhost',
  ssl: 'Amazon RDS'
})
```

Following profiles are included in the package:

* `Amazon RDS` - in this case https://s3.amazonaws.com/rds-downloads/mysql-ssl-ca-cert.pem CA cert is used

## Ignoring Unauthorized SSL Errors

You can also connect to a MySQL server without providing an appropriate CA to trust. **This is highly discouraged** as being insecure.

```ts
const connection = await mysql.createConnection({
  host: 'localhost',
  ssl: {
    // DO NOT DO THIS
    // set up your ca correctly to trust the connection
    rejectUnauthorized: false
  }
})
```
