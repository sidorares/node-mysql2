# History and Why MySQL2

MySQL2 project is a continuation of [MySQL-Native][mysql-native]. Protocol parser code was rewritten from scratch and api changed to match popular [mysqljs/mysql][node-mysql]. MySQL2 team is working together with [mysqljs/mysql][node-mysql] team to factor out shared code and move it under [mysqljs][node-mysql] organisation.

MySQL2 is mostly API compatible with [mysqljs][node-mysql] and supports majority of features. MySQL2 also offers these additional features:

 - Faster / Better Performance
 - [Prepared Statements](/docs/documentation/prepared-statements)
 - MySQL Binary Log Protocol
 - [MySQL Server](/docs/documentation/mysql-server)
 - Extended support for Encoding and Collation
 - [Promise Wrapper](/docs/documentation/promise-wrapper)
 - Compression
 - SSL and [Authentication Switch](/docs/documentation/authentication-switch)
 - [Custom Streams](/docs/documentation/extras#connecting-using-custom-stream)
 - [Pooling](/docs/#using-connection-pools)
