# Prepared Statements

MySQL2 provides `execute` helper which will prepare and query the statement.
You can also manually prepare / unprepare statement with `prepare` / `unprepare` methods.

See detailed documentaion in [Prepared Statements](/docs/documentation/prepared-statements).

:::tip
If you execute same statement again, it will be picked form a **LRU cache** which will save query preparation time and give better performance.
